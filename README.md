# Open-Source-Virtual-Try-On-Platform
Marketing Doctor: Democratizing Eyecare with an Open-Source Virtual Try-On Platform. Virtual-Tryon-Eyewear Public Approved by Open Forge, An Initiative of Govt of India

Marketing Doctor aims to develop a free, open-source, and accessible virtual try-on platform for eyewear, complete with online pupillary distance (PD) measurement and other vision-related features. This platform will empower enterprises like Lenskart and Eyeglasses.com to offer their customers a realistic and convenient virtual try-on experience. More importantly, by making this technology available in the public domain, MarketingDoctor has the potential to address the vision correction needs of millions in India and globally, particularly in underserved communities with limited access to traditional eye care.

Problem:

Access to proper eye care and corrective eyewear remains a challenge for a significant portion of the global population. Traditional methods of purchasing eyewear often require in-person visits to optometrists and physical stores, posing barriers related to cost, accessibility, and convenience. Existing virtual try-on solutions are often proprietary, expensive, and not readily available to smaller businesses or for public health initiatives. Furthermore, accurate PD measurement, crucial for proper lens fitting, is often overlooked or requires specialized equipment.

Solution:

MarketingDoctor will provide a robust and user-friendly open-source platform that includes:

Virtual Try-On: Utilizing advanced image processing and computer vision techniques, the platform will allow users to virtually try on eyeglasses using their webcam or mobile phone camera. This will provide a realistic preview of how different frames will look on their face.
Online PD Measurement: Integrated within the platform will be a reliable and accurate method for users to measure their pupillary distance (PD) online, eliminating the need for specialized tools or in-person assistance. This feature is crucial for ensuring proper lens alignment and optimal vision correction.
Additional Vision-Related Features (Future Development): The project envisions expanding to include other features like:
Prescription Input: Allowing users to input their eyeglass prescription for a more personalized try-on experience.
Frame Recommendation: Suggesting suitable frame styles based on facial features and prescription.
Eye Health Information: Providing educational resources about eye health and common vision problems.
Marketing Doctor has the potential to:

Empower Businesses: Provide smaller eyewear retailers and startups with access to cutting-edge virtual try-on technology, leveling the playing field and fostering innovation.
Improve Access to Eyecare: Make virtual try-on and PD measurement accessible to individuals in remote areas or those with limited mobility, facilitating access to vision correction.
Reduce Costs: Lower the barrier to entry for both businesses and consumers, potentially reducing the overall cost of eyewear.
Raise Awareness: Increase awareness about the importance of eye health and encourage regular eye exams.
Open Source Nature:

By being open source, MarketingDoctor encourages community involvement, collaboration, and continuous improvement. This also ensures that the technology remains accessible and affordable, maximizing its impact on global eye care.
